<p>I am a web developer and Bootstrap specialist living in Orlando, Florida. I'm also the creator of a website called <a href="http://startbootstrap.com">Start Bootstrap</a> which is a library of open source themes and templates for the Bootstrap framework. I personally create and maintain all of the themes available on Start Bootstrap, and they are free to download and use for any purpose!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironsummitmedia.com">Iron Summit Media Strategies</a> is the independent web development and digital marketing agency that I own and run. Our main focus is in front end web development for small to medium sized clients, and we also provide digital marketing consulting and services to a select group of local, nationwide, and international organizations.</p>

<p>Although I am a web developer by trade, my educational background is in business. I currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Management (Entrepreneurship Track) from the University of Central Florida, along with a Master's in Business Administration (MBA) with a certificate in Technology Ventures.</p>

<p>When I am not building websites or helping businesses with their digital marketing efforts, I am either practicing Capoeira (a Brazilian martial art) or plaing some PC games.</p>

<p>If you have questions about Start Bootstrap, Iron Summit Media Strategies, or anything else, feel free to contact me and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
